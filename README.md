# vfdmod
Vfdmod is a tiny HAL user space extension to control VFD over MODBUS RTU protocol. Vfdmod takes settings (such as VFD registers, control values, hal pin names, their types etc.) from an ini file, so no need to specify a lot of command line arguments.

This project is in development stage!!!
