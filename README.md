# About
Vfdmod is a LinuxCNC userspace component designed to control any VFD what supports MODBUS RTU protocol.

# Features
- All parameters are stored in a single plain text ini-file. This file describes communication settings, spindle limits, VFD's control registers to run spindle cw/ccw, any count of user defined parameters such as output current, frequency, temperature etc.
- Vfdmod has additional HAL pins to track RS485 communication status: is VFD connected (or not), total count of communication errors and last error code.
- Built-in PyVcp generator to make a simple control panel, what can be attached to Axis main window.
