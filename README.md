# About
Vfdmod is a LinuxCNC HAL userspace interface to control any VFD what supports MODBUS RTU protocol.

# Features
- Vfdmod takes settings from a single INI file, so you don't need to specify a lot of command line arguments after a 'loadusr -W'.
- Vfdmod provides full control of your VFD: spindle start forward/reverse, spindle stop, output speed monitoring and 'at-speed' signal conditioning.
- Vfdmod allows to monitor any count of VFD's registers and turns return value to float or signed/unsigned integer at user's choice.
- Vfdmod constantly monitors RS485 bus, it allows to count in/out errors and always to know last error code. These two parameters are also available for user as a HAL pins.
